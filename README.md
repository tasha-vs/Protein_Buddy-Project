This is a mobile application I developed for my final project in my 'Mobile Application Development' paper I completed at WelTec in 2019. 
It is an app that helps vegetarians (or anyone!) calculate protein from specific recipes. 
It contains a SQLite database. 
It was developed within Android Studio using Java.
